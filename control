Description: Optimized BLAS (linear algebra) library (shared library)
 OpenBLAS is an optimized BLAS library based on GotoBLAS2 1.13 BSD version.
 .
 Unlike Atlas, OpenBLAS provides a multiple architecture library.
 .
 All kernel will be included in the library and dynamically switched to
 the best architecture at run time (only on amd64, arm64 and i386).
 .
 For more information on how to rebuild locally OpenBLAS, see the section:
 "Building Optimized OpenBLAS Packages on your ARCH" in README.Debian
