How to switch between the various BLAS/LAPACK implementations
=============================================================

- BLAS:

 $ sudo update-alternatives --config libblas.so.3-<multiarch>

- LAPACK:

 $ sudo update-alternatives --config liblapack.so.3-<multiarch>

where <multiarch> is the multiarch path for you architecture (e.g.
x86_64-linux-gnu for amd64).

Building an optimized OpenBLAS package for your machine
=======================================================

On amd64, arm64, i386, loong64, ppc64el and s390x, libopenblas provides a
multiple architecture library. All kernels are included in the library and the
one matching best your processor is selected at run time. Recompiling locally
should bring minimal performance improvement.

On the contrary, on other architectures, the package is compiled with minimal
optimizations, so that it can run on all hardware. You may want to recompile it
locally for optimal performance.

If you want to create a custom OpenBLAS package, optimized for your specific
machine, proceed as follows.

1) Install the build dependencies and the source of the package:

 $ sudo apt-get build-dep openblas
 $ apt-get source openblas

2) Compile the package:

 $ cd openblas-<UPSTREAM_VERSION>
 $ DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=custom dpkg-buildpackage -uc -b

where <UPSTREAM_VERSION> is replaced with the appropriate value.

3) When the build finishes, it should produce several .deb files, whose precise
names you can figure out using:

 $ ls ../libopenblas*.deb

Install those that you want using dpkg. For the 32-bit indexing version, you
need at least libopenblas0 and one of the three of
libopenblas0-{openmp,pthread,serial}. For the 64-bit indexing version, you need
at least libopenblas64-0 and one of the three of
libopenblas64-0-{openmp,pthread,serial}

4) If you don't want the Debian package manager to overwrite your optimized
package with a generic one on system upgrades, you can mark the OpenBLAS
package to be on hold, with the following command (for the 32-bit indexing
version):

 $ sudo apt-mark hold libopenblas0 libopenblas0-{openmp,pthread,serial}

Don't forget however to periodically check whether a more recent version of the
package is available for the Debian suite that you are tracking, in which case
you should go again through this procedure. The version check can be performed
using:

 $ aptitude versions libopenblas0
