How to switch between the various BLAS/LAPACK implementations
=============================================================

BLAS:
$ sudo update-alternatives --config libblas.so.3

LAPACK:
$ sudo update-alternatives --config liblapack.so.3

Building an optimized OpenBLAS package for your machine
=======================================================

On amd64 and i386, libopenblas-base provides a multiple architecture library.
All kernels are included in the library and the one matching your architecture
is selected at run time. Recompiling locally should bring minimal performance
improvement.

On the contrary, on non-x86 archs, the package is compiled with minimal
optimizations, so that it can run on all hardware. You may want to recompile it
locally for optimal performance.

If you want to create a custom OpenBLAS package, optimized for your specific
machine, proceed as follows.

Install the build dependencies:

$ sudo aptitude build-dep openblas

Get the sources of the package:

$ apt-get source openblas

Compile the package:

$ cd openblas-<VERSION>
$ DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=custom dpkg-buildpackage -uc -b

It should produce a package that you can install with:

$ sudo dpkg -i ../libopenblas-base_<DEBVERSION>.deb
