Description: Optimized BLAS (linear algebra) library based on GotoBLAS2
 OpenBLAS is an optimized BLAS library based on GotoBLAS2 1.13 BSD version.
 .
 Unlike Atlas, OpenBLAS provides a multiple architecture library.
 .
 All kernel will be included in the library and dynamically switched
 the best architecutre at run time.
